        <p>My individual project idea is to create a site that focuses on the music industry, specifically music booking and management<p> 
        <p>I will be utilizing content from my past music management and music booking internships</p>
        <p>The website will consist of images and videos from past artists I have worked with and past concert events I have attended</p>
        <p>The following pages will explain the process of management and booking</p>
        <p>It will be broken up into 4 sections titled Events, Artists, Job Description, Additional information</p>

            <dt>music booking</dt>
            <dd>booking artists for shows</dd>
