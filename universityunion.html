<h2> What is University Union?</h2>
<article class="page-description">
<p>University Union is the official programming board of Syracuse University. We are entirely run by a team of dedicated students and are one of the largest registered student organizations here at SU in terms of budget, membership, and size and frequency of our events. We host large scale concert events including our annual Juice Jam festival in September and Mayfest and Block Party in April. Additionally, we keep campus entertained throughout the year with our smaller Bandersnatch Concert, weekly cinemas screenings, special advanced screening, and events featuring popular comedians and speakers.

UU has served as the primary source of large-scale entertainment on the Syracuse campus ever since our establishment in 1962. We are dedicated to providing diverse and comprehensive programming that appeals to all members of our community.  </p>

    <p id="data" class="col-sm-12 col-sm-12">I have worked on the PR board for "UU" for three years now. The assistant acts as the liaison between the PR Director and the press. They are in charge of coordinating press pass requests to be approved by the PR Director and artist management, as well as assisting the PR Director day-of- show with escorting photographers to and from the pit. During this time,I have gained valuable experience  with all aspects of the music industry. Booking, marketing, and public relations. We have booked, organized and hosted events every year. Our two main events are our Juice Jam and Mayfest concerts. This past semester we had 21 Savage come to perform at Juice Jam and Michael Che came to do standup for our "Night of Comedy" show. As the assistant PR director for UU, I worked with press during the day of the concert. I handled credentials as well as what was allowed to be recorded from press. I also helped to conduct interviews with the artists that came to perform. </p>

   <p id="data" class="col-sm-12 col-sm-12">As a PR board, we run the blog and work with social media and marketing to promote the event and give recaps of the event. We essentially handle UU's brand and make sure that we have good relationships with press, and other organizations on campus. The Board consists of three blog writers, a blog coordinator, an assistant PR director and a PR director. Each member of the team has a designated job but it is an extremely collaborative board. The blog editor covers most UU events for the blog, edits pieces by UU staff writers, and posts them to the University Union Blog. This position works closely with the PR Director to consistently try to produce our own internal press, rather than solely relying on on-campus publications. The Blog Editor also assists the PR Director with any long-term projects she/he may have for the semester, as well as assisting the PR Director and Assistant with press day-of- show. The assistant to the Blog Editor will contribute to the University Union blog through writing their own pieces, editing pieces, and interviewing artists day of show (DOS). The assistant will also help the Blog Editor with any long-term projects. The Public Relations Director acts as the official spokesperson for the entire organization. The PR Director works with campus and local press with media requests, collaborate with artist management on media, and coordinate and execute artist interviews. They are responsible for building and maintaining relationships with publications</p>

    <p id="data"> University Union puts on two big concerts every year. There is one is September called "Juice Jam" and one in May called "Mayfest/ Blockparty". This year's Mayfest had an amazing lineup of artists like Kilo Kish, Fletcher, Mount Joy and our headliner 21 Savage. The event takes place on Syracuse University's south campus and goes all day. It can be described as a festival of sorts, but all in one day as opposed to several. This year for Juice Jam I spent most of my time dealing with press and working in "the pit" which is the area right before the stage where the press can take pictures and film. Then once the performance was over, I would direct press back to their designated tent and wait for the next performance. I also conducted interviews with the artists who came to perform for our University Union Blog. Any other tasks I had to do were helping out the PR Director with anything she needed and making sure the event was running smoothly.</p>
