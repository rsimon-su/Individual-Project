<h2> What is University Union?</h2>
<article class="page-description">
<p>University Union is the main programming organization for Syracuse University. I have worked on the PR board for "UU" for three years now. During this time, I have gained valuable experience  with all aspects of the music industry. Booking, marketing, and public relations. We have booked, organized and hosted events every year. Our two main events are our Juice Jam and Mayfest concerts. This past semester we had 21 Savage come to perform at Juice Jam and Michael Che came to do standup for our "Night of Comedy" show. </p>

    <p>As the assistant PR director for UU, I worked with press during the day of the concert. I handled credentials as well as what was allowed to be recorded from press. I also helped to conduct interviews with the artists that came to perform. </p>

    <p>As a PR board, we run the blog and work with social media and marketing to promote the event and give recaps of the event. We essentially handle UU's brand. </p>
